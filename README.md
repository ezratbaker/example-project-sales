# Grocery Sales Analysis & Customer Segmentation Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed transactional sales data for a retail company to identify **top-performing products, categories, and employees**, and to segment **high-value customers** for targeted engagement. By using **SQL, Python, and data visualization**, I provided actionable insights that could support **loyalty programs, rewards strategies, and sales team optimization**.

## Featured Skills

- ✅ **SQL**: Multi-table joins, aggregation, calculated fields, subqueries
- 🐍 **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)**: Data wrangling, analysis, and visualization
- 📊 **Customer Segmentation**: High-value customer identification
- 📈 **Sales Performance Analysis**: Products, categories, employees
- 📦 **Data Acquisition**: Kaggle API, file handling (zip extraction)
- 🔀 **Database Management**: SQLite, SQL-Python integration
- 🔍 **Data Validation**: Preview, QA checks, filtered metrics

## Project Structure

- **grocery_sales.ipynb**: Full project code and analysis with markdown explanations
- **Non-Technical Summary.pdf**: One-page, stakeholder-facing summary of key findings and strategic insights

## Key Findings

- 🌐 Identified **top 10 products** and **top 10 categories** by revenue (in millions USD)
- 📅 Analyzed **distribution of customer spend** and segmented **691 high-value customers** (spending $100,000+)
- 📈 Evaluated **employee performance** by total sales revenue

## Business Impact

The company can now engage **high-value customers** through **rewards, loyalty programs, or retention strategies**, and optimize performance by focusing on **top-selling products** and **high-performing employees**.
