# Grocery Sales Analysis & Customer Segmentation Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed transactional sales data for a retail company to identify **top-performing products, categories, and employees**, and to segment **high-value customers** for targeted engagement. By using **SQL, Python, and data visualization**, I provided actionable insights that could support **loyalty programs, rewards strategies, and sales team optimization**.
